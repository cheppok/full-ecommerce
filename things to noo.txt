To use a hex color like #FFFFFF (which is white) as a background in Tailwind CSS, you can utilize the built-in utility classes. In this case, you would use the bg-white class. Here’s how you can do it:

Example
html
Copy code
<div class="bg-white">
    <!-- Your content here -->
</div>
Custom Colors
If you need to use a custom hex color that isn’t included in Tailwind’s default palette, you can extend the Tailwind configuration. Here’s how to do that:

Edit tailwind.config.js: Add your custom color to the theme.extend.colors section.

javascript
Copy code
// tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  theme: {
    extend: {
      colors: {
        customWhite: '#FFFFFF', // Add your custom color here
      },
    },
  },
  variants: {},
  plugins: [],
};
Use the Custom Class: After extending the configuration, you can use your custom color class in your HTML.

html
Copy code
<div class="bg-customWhite">
    <!-- Your content here -->
</div>
Note
Make sure to rebuild your CSS after updating the Tailwind configuration so the new classes take effect. If you’re using a build tool, this typically happens automatically when you save your changes.
